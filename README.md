Rcam2 is my second attempt at making a real-time volumetric/AR VFX system with [Unity]
(the first attempt is [here]). This time I used iPad Pro with a LiDAR scanner.

[Unity]: https://unity.com/
[here]: https://github.com/keijiro/Rcam

System Requirements
-------------------

- HDRP-compatible desktop system
- iPad Pro with LiDAR scanner (2020 model)

How To Run
----------

1. Build and run the RcamController project on the iPad device.
1. Play the RcamVisualizer project on the desktop system.
